</div>

Feynman UNO Flip is an educational card game that brings the complexities of particle physics to life through interactive gameplay. Originally developed as a physical card game for a university project in collaboration with lecturers, researchers, and UCL (University College London) Business, this virtual version aims to make the game accessible to a broader audience. Inspired by the interactive sessions held with GCSE and A-Level students, this online version allows players to learn particle physics concepts anywhere in the world.

## Game Rules

The game follows a set of unique rules inspired by particle physics principles:

- **Color and Particle Matching**: Players can play a card that matches the color or particle type of the current card.
- **Boson Rule**: When a boson card is played, the next card must be of the same class as the bottom card.
- **Weak Boson/Photon Rule**: Cards can be played as long as charge conservation holds, and the particle is not a boson.
- **Gluon Rule**: When a gluon is played, the next card must match the particle type exactly.

For a complete list of rules and gameplay mechanics, please refer to the in-game tutorial or the rules section in the app.

## Usage
Playing the Game:

- Navigate to the game URL or run it locally.
- Create or join a game.
- Use the interface to draw cards, play cards, and flip the deck.
- Follow the in-game prompts and tutorials to understand the gameplay mechanics.

## Admin Controls
Admins can manage games through the admin controls page. The admin interface includes features to:
 - Reset games
 - Remove inactive games
 - Monitor active games and players

## Known Issues and TODOs
- **Animations**: Implement card animations for smoother gameplay.
- **Flip Mechanic**: Currently, flipping doesn't affect other players' views. This might become a feature.
- **Card Highlighting**: When flipping locally, the highlight on cards may not persist.
- **Interactive Instructions**: Improve in-game instructions.
- **Card Positioning on iOS**: Fix card positioning issues on iOS devices.
- **Game Manager**: Add a game manager feature for better control over game sessions.
- **Button Edge Cases**: Address edge cases related to button press timings.
