Need to make it clearer what happens when playing on H

GAME RULES CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED:

Can play same color or same particle type
If playing on a boson played card needs to be the same class as the bottom card
If a weak boson or photon are played as long as charge conservation holds and particle is not a boson
If a gluon is played particle needs to be exactly the same type.

Features:

For some reason the play card function gets called like 6 million times but draw card doesnt
